# SSE_Predcition
This project focuses on predicting protein secondary structure elements (alpha-helices, beta-sheets, and coils) using a combination of established tools (PSIPRED and JPRED APIs) and custom methods. The custom approach involves utilizing amino acid properties and a neural network-based model trained with TensorFlow and Keras. The model achieves promising results with a test accuracy of 86.39% and a test loss of 0.3302, offering an alternative to homology-based methods for secondary structure prediction. The code and implementation are available on GitHub.
